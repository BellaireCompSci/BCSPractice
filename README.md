# BCSPractice
Solutions and input data for practice problems used by the Bellaire CS Club

### Info
The problems are broken up into packages that group the problems by their origin.
Each package has a few problems, and they are intended to cover a range of difficulty to be useful to people of various skill levels.

Along with each package, there is a link below to a Google Drive folder that contains a document with the written descriptions of each problem, as well as the sample input data files.

Note: *most are UIL problems in released packets given [here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/scottm/uil/practiceMaterials.html)*
